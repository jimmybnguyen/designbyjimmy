            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="text-portfolio">Leadr was created for Design Thinking (INFO 360) taught by Andrew J. Ko. In this class, students learned what designers do, how they do it, and how to do some of the things they do. Topics the class covered includes user research, ideation and prototyping, user interfaces and critique, and evaluation. To demonstrate what we learned, each student in the class paired with another student to work on a final project. My design partner was Chris Oh.</p>
            <h2>Interview</h2>
            <p class="text-portfolio">We selected another pair of student as our "sister" team and interviewed one of them to find problems that we could solve for college students. We asked questions such as, “What activities give you stress, and why” and “What are some activities that you enjoy doing.” Some questions probed around leisure activities, such as “How often do you go on trips or enjoy activities with friends.” We found that planning an event with multiple friends can be cumbersome when considering everyone’s preference and opinions, which leads to indecisiveness. Our interviewee stated that it is important for students to attend social events with others to reduce stress, but it becomes difficult to plan when there are simple difficulties such as time arrangements when under the load of schoolwork.</p> 
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p class="text-portfolio">From the answers that our interviewee provided, <strong>we discovered that the difficulties with planning activities with a group of friends is not necessarily with just the logistical details, but also with coming up with a decision</strong>. Every participant of an activity introduces factors such as time, budget, and interests, and these factors can conflict. This conflict creates an indecisiveness environment. In a casual group, there is usually equal power spread among the members. An environment where everyone is equal can make it difficult for an individual to break a deadlock when no one is willing to evaluate the current conflicts and situations to come up with a final decision for the whole group. Our interviewee have had events cancelled due to the group’s inability to make a decision for time-sensitive activities. Both of these play a negative role in the environment of a group, and can create conflicts later on due to reduced trust in the group’s ability to create and attend social gatherings.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p class="text-portfolio">To solve this problem, we chose to create a mobile app that uses an alternating leadership system in groups. Instead of every group member having equal equity at the same time, this systems allows everyone to have equal equity over time. </p><br>
            <p class="text-portfolio">The group starts out with one leader who will create an event for the group. Once the event is made, the creator is sent to the very back of the queue, and a new leader takes their place to plan the next event. Out of all the decision making methods out there, we found that this is one of the better and simpler ways to evoke fun and fair activities within groups.</p><br>
            <p class="text-portfolio">One of the more popular ways to decide from a variety of options is to have a vote. However, a simple majority rule is unfair to people with minority viewpoints. Having a leader in a group often results in a higher decision-quality relative to majority-decision making. This alternating leadership system allows everyone in a group to have a chance to be an authoritative figure, which has the added benefit of getting people comfortable with being a leader.</p>
