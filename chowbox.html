                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="text-portfolio">ChowBox was created in the Informatics Special Topics course: Rapid Prototyping at the University of Washington. In this class, teams research, concept, design, prototype, and test a new consumer product in the first two weeks, then rinse and repeat the process three additional times using an agile methodology to iterate and refine the product based on user feedback.</p><br>
                <p class="text-portfolio">My Role: overall design language, map and cart screens, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UJYzSgAA-g" target="_blank">product overview video</a></p>


                <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
                <p class="text-portfolio">This first sprint was all about seeing whether there was interest in our service. We got 12 people in the computer lab to order a type of pizza using our paper prototype, and then walk to the lounge nearby to pick up their food. We then conducted a quick interview with them about the process they just went through. The five questions we asked were: What did you think about this process? If you had the option to order food on campus and then pick it up, would you? If you had the option to order food on the Ave and then pick it up, would you? If you were using an app like this, what features would you expect? Do you have any additional suggestions/feedback you would like to give us? </p>
                <h3>App</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We wanted to focus on the ordering process for this next sprint find the best way for people to order food on their phones, and then picking it up at a location (instead of having it delivered, which is what most people are used to).</p>

            <div class="max-width">                       
                <h3>Box</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">The team had one big decision to make for this sprint: have the box open automatically, or have the users open the box manually. In the end, we chose to have the box open automatically because we wanted our "wow" moment to be when a user inputs in their ChowCode and have the correct box opens itself like magic. Jeff, our Product Engineer, was in charge of creating this magic moment. He gathered a lock solenoid, spring, 12V battery supply, breadboard, and some wires to make it happen. For the box itself, we brought in several cardboard boxes and chose the one we thought was the best size.</p>

            <div class="max-width">                                     
                <h3>Interview</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We asked the same questions from the previous sprint because our test remained mostly the same: someone would order food, then go to the box to pick it up. With a more flushed out paper prototype, as well as the box, we wanted to see people's reactions when opening the box for the first time.</p><br>
                <p class="text-portfolio">Similar to the previous sprint, we got mostly positive feedback overall, and saw that there was high interest for a service like ChowBox. The high point for ChowBox was definitely entering the passcode and seeing the box pop open. The low points were mainly with the paper prototype. We used the words "Pick-up Window" to indicate how long a user has to pick up their food. Almost everyone found the wording to be confusing because they thought there was a physical window they had to go to.</p>                                                                                           

                <h2>Sprint 2</h2>
                <p class="text-portfolio">While we received positive feedback about our idea, we wanted to stick with a low-fidelity test for this sprint as well because our paper prototype and box in the previous sprint was not close to our original vision. We went into detail about the ordering process for the paper prototype for this sprint, and made a cardboard ChowBox that pops open.</p>
                <h3>App</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We had two simple screens for our paper prototype: one with an option for meat or cheese pizza, and a second screen telling the user which box their food is in. We also gave them a little slip of paper with a letter on it to act as the security feature for our box.</p>

                <h3>Box</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We used the boxes the pizza came in as our first box prototype. Each box was labeled A or B, and the testers had to give the slip of paper to one of our group members, who would then tell them to pick up a slice from the box.</p><br>

            <div class="max-width">                                                                
                <h3>Interview</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">Overall, we received positive feedback about our idea. Most people found the process of ordering food and then picking it up to be simple, intuitive, and convenient. We explained our idea of having a box to keep the food at an appropriate temperature, and people were all for it because it sets us apart from services such as Postmates, where the food could arrive cold.  The main concerns people had were about food quality and availability of boxes. </p>  


                <h2>Sprint 3</h2>
                <p class="text-portfolio">With only 2 more sprints to go, it was time to create high fidelity prototypes for in-depth testing. Instead of having our testers walk around the corner, we wanted them to walk to a restaurant from campus. We scheduled 3 tests with 3 different people, asked them what they wanted to order, and designed our screens accordingly. </p>
                <h3>App</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We moved from paper prototypes to an InVision prototype for this sprint. The prototype can be found below Sprint 4. To simulate an app notification, we used Messenger and send our testers their ChowCode while they were on their way. </p>
                <h3>Box</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We wrapped the cardboard box with white paper to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Two heating pages, along with a temperature gauge, were added to the box to simulate temperature control. Finally, a window was cut on the door because we thought it would be exciting for people to see their food waiting for them. </p>      
                <h3>Interview</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We had four questions for our testers this sprint: What did you think about this process? How would you score ChowBox out of 10? What are the values of this service for you? How far do you see yourself traveling for a service like ChowBox?</p><br>
                <p class="text-portfolio">Our three testers found this process to be easy and intuitive. The main pain points had to deal with the app itself, with our testers giving it a lower score overall than the box. Our testers found the box to be the most exciting part of the project, but one was concerned with how fragile it looked. The values of this service that our tester listed were: already paid for the food on the app (however, the restaurants may not find it to be very profitable), using an app is less hassle than calling on the phone, no delivery fees, and the ability to skip pass the lines during busy hours. Finally, our testers said that they would travel to the Ave from campus to use this service (about 0.5 miles), but not sure about further distances. It is worth noting that we only tested college students in this sprint who do not regularly drive. </p>

            <div class="max-width">   
                <h2>Sprint 4</h2>
                <p class="text-portfolio">We did not do any testing for this sprint, just polishing up the app and box before the final presentation in front of the class and invited guests.</p>
                <h3>App</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">From our user testing in the previous sprint, we found 2 main concerns. First, there was no way to customize orders. The app did not support food items with multiple options, such as meat. We also found the description of the food items to be unnecessary. We removed the description, added a picture to each food item, and implemented a pop-up modal where users can customize their orders.</p><br> 
                <p class="text-portfolio">The other issue we had was that the "Call Restaurant" button on the confirmation screen was confusing. Our testers found themselves confused on what to do next once they finished placing their orders. All three of them tapped the Call Restaurant" button because they thought that was what they had to do after ordering. To fix this, we removed the button completely and replaced it with a phone number, because we felt that it was still important to include, and added a message on top of the screen that read "Your order has been placed!".</p>

                <h3>Box</h3>             
                <p class="text-portfolio">We upgraded the box from cardboard to acrylic. The overall design of the box remained the same, but we switched out the breadboard for an Arduino in order to connect a Bluetooth module. We used our phones to act as a keypad for the box. Using the default Arduino Bluetooth app, we were able to simulate what it would be like to input in a ChowCode through a UI. </p><br>
